//lets make User â€“ authentication, role, profile info. Product â€“ what youâ€™re selling. Category â€“ for filtering & navigation. Order â€“ to track purchases. Cart â€“ active shopping session. Wishlist â€“ saved items for later. ðŸŸ¡ Supporting Models (important but not 100% required at MVP launch) Review / Rating â€“ boosts engagement & trust, but you can launch without it. Payment â€“ if you use an external gateway (Stripe/PayPal), you can just store status in Order and skip this as a separate model until you need more detailed logging. Shipment / Delivery â€“ nice for tracking, but if youâ€™re a small store at first, shipping details can just live inside Order. Inventory Logs â€“ useful for audit/history, but you can start with just a stock field in Product. theese first
